# CSES ProblemSets

## PTR (based on my experirence :P)

- While chosing of datatype, keep in mind of the values, the logic will be generating in intermidiate form

- To initialize a ARRAY with a specific value in C++ just `int ARR[10] = {8}` 
    this will create a array size 10 with value 8 for every index
